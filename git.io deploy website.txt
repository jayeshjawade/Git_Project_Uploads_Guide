Create a repository
Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, 
where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:
cd username.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
Add, commit, and push your changes:
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
…and you're done!
Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.
